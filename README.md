# Data-Augmentation-Keystrokes-Dynamics

## Comparison of data augmentation methods
1) avg calculations based on train dataset only
2) avg calculations based on both train and test datasets

### The augmentation is based on avg dwell time for each key, then gaussian noise is applied and eventually added random values (ms time).
1] avg
2] gaussian noise
3] random [-X, X] values
